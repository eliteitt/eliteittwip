        <h1>Dr Giao (Grace) Quynh Tran</h1>
        <h3> Founder<br>
        Principal Interpreter, Translator &amp; Teacher</h3>
        <p><a href="https://benchtv.com.au/presenter/dr-giao-quynh-tran-dr-grace-tran/" target="_blank">Dr Tran</a> has a PhD in Applied Linguistics from the University of Melbourne, an MA
in English (Applied Linguistics) and a Graduate Certificate in Teaching English to
Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) from University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI,
USA, a Graduate Diploma in TESOL from Canberra University and a BA in English
from Vietnam National University. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlKCC54tnaU" target="_blank">She</a> is also a NAATI Professional Interpreter and Translator in English and Vietnamese, both directions.</p>
     <p>As a professional interpreter and translator, Dr Tran is <a href="https://www.eliteitt.com.au/pages/testimonies.html" target="_blank">known for</a> her skills in legal, (legal) medical, political and general interpreting and translation as well as in simultaneous / conference interpreting. With more than twenty five years of experience in interpreting and translating in Vietnam, USA, and Australia including the last seventeen years of experience as a Professional Interpreter and Translator in English and Vietnamese, both directions, specializing in court interpreting in Australia, together with her strong academic background in Applied Linguistics, she has received a lot of compliments from legal and medical practitioners, politicians, community leaders, delegates, directors, TV audiences, colleagues, clients, etc. on her consecutive and simultaneous interpreting skills in courts, consultations, conferences and workshops as well as on live TV. She is interpreting and translating only at Elite Interpreters, Translators & Teachers (ELITE ITT). Throughout her interpreting and translating career, not a single client is less than happy with her work. </p>
    <p>As a teacher, Dr Tran has complete confidence in her teaching capacity with fifteen years of teaching experience. She has been able to deliver quality education and create a supportive environment for her students. Following years of experience teaching English (TESOL) as a staff member in the Department of English Linguistics and Literature, School of Social Sciences and Humanities at Vietnam National University and teaching English as a Second Language (ESL) as well as tutoring in postgraduate Linguistics and Applied Linguistics programs in Vietnam, USA and Australia, she taught postgraduate interpreting and translation as well as supervised MA theses in TESOL at the School of Humanities and Communication Arts, Western Sydney University. She is teaching Interpreting, Translation, English and Vietnamese exclusively at ELITE ITT. Her teaching has always been <a href="https://www.eliteitt.com.au/pages/testimonies.html" target="_blank">highly evaluated</a> by her students. </p>
<p>As a career researcher, Dr Tran has a track record of peer-reviewed publications and presentations (See details under <a href="research.html" target="_blank">Research</a>). With her Naturalized Role-play - an original methodology that she created for her <a href="https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3885126?lookfor=giao%20quynh%20tran&offset=1&max=1" target="_blank">PhD research</a>, she became one of the three researchers worldwide to win the Solidarity Award from the American Association for Applied Linguistics (AAAL) at the 2004 AAAL Conference. The Naturalized Role-play is considered revolutionary and her Pragmatic and Discourse Markedness Hypothesis ground-breaking by academics in the field. In June 2017, her <a href = "https://www.eliteitt.com.au/pages/research.html" target="_blank">Court Interpreting workshop at AUSIT</a> attracted great reviews. Her <a href="https://lsj.com.au/articles/interpreters-and-lawyers-why-we-must-work-together-for-better-outcomes/" target="_blank">article on court interpreting</a> in the Australian Law Society Journal (LSJ, April 2018, Issue 43) was also well-received. She was then invited to give a <a href = "https://benchtv.com.au/presenter/dr-giao-quynh-tran-dr-grace-tran/" target="_blank">presentation on legal interpreting</a> on Bench TV (broadcast on 15 November 2018). In December 2020, her research article about interpreting in cross-cultural in court was published on ScienceDirect by Elsevier in Oxford, Britain before print release in February 2021. </p>
