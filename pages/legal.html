            <h2> Why choose ELITE ITT <br>for all your (Vietnamese and English) Legal Interpreting and Translating needs?</h2>
            <p style="padding-top:10px;">When working with non-English speaking clients in legal processes, it is essential to secure the service of the best interpreter in the respective language because everything you have to build your case upon comes from the interpreter. A good interpreter gives you accuracy, which is to your advantage, whereas a bad interpreter can destroy your case. Unfortunately, when you have free interpreters provided by courts, you do not get to choose them. Even if you do, the best one does not work for agencies affiliated with courts.</p>
            <p>Bear in mind that top interpreters in each language are usually neither old ones nor newbies. Good interpreting requires accuracy, speed, concentration, short term memory, stamina, etc. All of these qualities deteriorate with age. Young ones, or newly certified ones at any age, however, lack experience, which matters in any profession. We are certainly not among newbies. Nor are we among old ones who may be losing out on what it takes to be good at this job. Given the aforementioned qualities required for good interpreting, this is not a profession for retirees or novices.</p>
            <p>Our Principal Interpreter and Translator - <a href="drgracetran.html" target="_blank">Dr Giao (Grace) Quynh Tran</a> - has decades of experience to ensure the quality of legal interpreting provided by ELITE ITT. She has regularly interpreted in various Local Courts in NSW, NSW District Courts in Sydney and Parramatta, Supreme Courts, Federal Court, Family Court, Children's Courts in Parramatta and Glebe, Administrative Appeals Tribunal including Migration and Refugee Division, NSW Police, AFP, etc.; and previously in Magistrates' Courts, County Court, Supreme Court, Federal Court, Migration Review Tribunal, Refugee Review Tribunal, VIC Police, AFP, etc. in Melbourne. Legal professionals whom she has worked with have unanimously complimented her on her accuracy in Court / Legal Interpreting. Dr Tran has also provided numerous accurate translations of legal documents, has written elaborate expert witness reports and has appeared a number of times as a defense expert witness in NSW District Court in Sydney.</p>
            <p>Dr Tran received great feedback for her <a href="https://www.eliteitt.com.au/pages/research.html" target="_blank"> AUSIT Court Interpreting workshop</a> and her <a href="https://lsj.com.au/articles/interpreters-and-lawyers-why-we-must-work-together-for-better-outcomes/" target="_blank">article on court interpreting</a> in the Australian Law Society Journal. She also gave a <a href="https://benchtv.com.au/presenter/dr-giao-quynh-tran-dr-grace-tran/" target="_blank">presentation on legal interpreting</a> by invitation on Bench TV.</p>
            <p>At ELITE ITT, we dedicate ourselves to providing barristers and solicitors with the best interpreting services in court proceedings, legal conferences, jail visits, psychological and medical assessments, etc.; second-to-none legal document translating services as well as the most reliable transcript checking and expert witness services while being cost effective. Moreover, our qualifications and expertise ensure the strength of our expert witness reports and our expert evidence. </p>
