        <h2>Why study at ELITE ITT?</h2>
        <p  style="padding-top:10px;"> ELITE ITT is set to always offer the highest quality teaching for the most affordable tuition fees. </p>
        <p><b>For the NAATI CCL, Interpreting and Translation tests:</b></p>
        <p> With reference to NAATI CCL, Interpreting and Translation test training, we all know that if you learn from a good interpreter, translator and teacher, chances are you will interpret or translate well. Otherwise, there is no chance you can be good at interpreting or translating. The following list helps you identify a good CCL, Interpreting and Translation teacher.</p>
        <p><i><b>1)   Teaching qualifications:</b></i></p>
        <p>Your teacher, first and foremost, needs to be qualified as a teacher. Being a NAATI interpreter is not enough to teach interpreting. Good teaching requires a high level of formal education, practical experience, talent, etc.</p>
        <p>At ELITE ITT, you will study with <a href="drgracetran.html" target="_blank">Dr Giao Quynh Tran</a> _ a highly qualified teacher.
        <ul><li>PhD in Applied Linguistics from the University of Melbourne</li>
            <li>MA in English from University of Wisconsin, USA</li>
            <li>Graduate Diploma in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) from Canberra University</li>
            <li>Graduate Certificate in TESOL from University of Wisconsin, USA</li>
            <li>NAATI Accredited Professional Interpreter and Translator in English and Vietnamese, both directions</li>
        </ul>     
        </p>
        <p><i><b>2)  Teaching experience:</b></i></p>
        <p>In the academia,  our Principal Teacher _ Dr Giao Quynh Tran _ has a decade and a half of experience teaching at tertiary level and in the private sector in Vietnam, the U.S. and Australia, having taught postgraduate interpreting and translation in English and Vietnamese, both directions, and having supervised MA theses in TESOL at Western Sydney University. She has been well-regarded by her students wherever she has taught and at ELITE ITT.</p>
        <p><i><b>3)   NAATI professional level accreditation:</b></i></p>
        <p> If a trained teacher is not a good, professional interpreter or not even a NAATI professional one, that one cannot be a good interpreting teacher. You cannot teach what you cannot do.</p>
        <p>Similarly, if a teacher is not a NAATI professional translator in the language direction you are studying, they are not in the position to teach you that subject.</p>
        <p>Dr Giao Quynh Tran is a NAATI Accredited Professional Interpreter and Translator in English and Vietnamese, both language directions.</p>
        <p><i><b>4) NAATI interpreting AND translating accreditation:</b></i></p>
        <p>Your teacher should be both a professional interpreter AND a professional translator in BOTH language directions. A professional interpreter without translating accreditation in both language directions cannot compare to the one who has all three.</p>
        <p>Dr Giao Quynh Tran at ELITE ITT has all three types of NAATI Accreditation as a:
            <ul> <li>Professional Interpreter in the English and Vietnamese languages</li>
            <ul> <li>Professional Translator from English into Vietnamese</li>
            <ul> <li>Professional Translator from Vietnamese into English</li>
            </ul></p>
        <p><i><b>5) Interpreting and translating experience:</b></i></p>
        <p>Check when your teacher obtained their NAATI accreditation / certification at the professional level. Accredited interpreters and translators are, for the most part, more experienced than certified ones because you can be sure that accredited ones became professionals before 2007.</p>
        <p>Dr Giao Quynh Tran is a NAATI Accredited Interpreter and Translator in English and Vietnamese, both directions. Her NAATI accreditation certificates are shown in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvEGCSAgJcU" target="_blank"> featured video</a> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNDBw_vFq_Yrpl0XPuYWCFw/featured" target="_blank"> ELITE ITT’s YouTube channel</a> on our <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
        <p>In the industry, Dr Tran is an established Vietnamese interpreter and translator with twenty five years of international interpreting and translating experience including seventeen years of experience as a professional Interpreter and Translator in English and Vietnamese, both directions, in Australia. She is substantially experienced in <a href="legal.html" target="_blank">Legal Interpreting</a>, <a href="medical.html" target="_blank">Medical Interpreting</a>, <a href="simultaneous.html" target="_blank">Simultaneous / Conference Interpreting</a>, <a href="phone.html" target="_blank">Phone Interpreting</a> and <a href="translation.html" target="_blank">Translation</a>. </p>
        <p><i><b>6) Research and good standing in the field:</b></i></p>
        <p>Teaching and research go hand in hand. Check your teacher’s research profile to see what they have done for the profession.</p>
        <p>Dr Giao Quynh Tran has carried out fruitful research projects resulting in peer – reviewed <a href="research.html" target="_blank">publications and presentations</a>. Her Naturalized Role-play, which she created for her <a href="https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3885126?lookfor=giao%20quynh%20tran&offset=1&max=1" target="_blank">PhD research</a>, won her the Solidarity Award from the American Association for Applied Linguistics (AAAL) at the 2004 AAAL Conference. Based on peer review, she has done a great job supervising MA theses in TESOL at Western Sydney University. She also received very positive feedback on her <a href="https://lsj.com.au/articles/interpreters-and-lawyers-why-we-must-work-together-for-better-outcomes/" target="_blank">article on court interpreting</a> in the Australian Law Society Journal. In addition, she gave a <a href="https://benchtv.com.au/presenter/dr-giao-quynh-tran-dr-grace-tran/" target="_blank">presentation on legal interpreting</a> by invitation on Bench TV.</p>
        <p><i><b>7) Being both a good interpreter & translator AND a good teacher:</b></i></p>
        <p>One needs to be both a good interpreter & translator AND a good teacher to teach interpreting and/or translation well.</p>
        <p>Dr Giao Quynh Tran has received a lot of <a href="https://www.eliteitt.com.au/pages/testimonies.html" target="_blank">compliments</a> on her interpreting & translating expertise AND on her teaching quality. Moreover, Dr Tran was praised for her expertise by attendants at her <a href="https://www.eliteitt.com.au/pages/research.html"_blank">AUSIT Court Interpreting workshop</a>. </p>
        <p><i><b>8) Passion for the profession:</b></i></p>
        <p>Good professionals are passionate about their work but not all passionate people are good at their profession.</p>
        <p>Dr Giao Quynh Tran’s passion is in teaching, interpreting, translating and research. She is motivated to help others with her expertise. 
                <p><i><b>9) Talent:</b></i></p>
        <p>To be at the top of any profession, you need not only hard work but also talent. Talent needs formal training to develop but without talent, you can hardly set yourself apart from the rest.</p>
        <p>Become a student of Dr Tran and you will be able to tell for yourself how good she is as a teacher.</p>
                
               
        <p><b>For the TOEFL iBT, IELTS, PTE Academic, OET & CAE Tests:</b></p>
                <p>1)      We have <i><b>been there, done that</b></i>.</p>
                <p>Our Principal Teacher _ <a href="drgracetran.html" target="_blank">Dr Giao Quynh Tran</a> _ achieved the top TOEFL score, which helped win her a scholarship for her MA studies in the U.S. So she, together with ELITE ITT, knows very well how to help students, especially Vietnamese ones, do well in the English tests.</p>
        <p><i><b>2)    Teaching qualifications and experience in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL)</b></i></p>
        <p>Our Principal Teacher - Dr Giao Quynh Tran - is a highly qualified English teacher (See Teaching qualifications above).
