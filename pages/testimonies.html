            <h1>Testimonials</h1>
            <p>Grace is a highly professional interpreter who interprets with great accuracy. We hired Grace for her interpreting services in several matters and we are very impressed with her
		    abilities.</p>
            <p>We hired Grace's services in relation to a major claim which required the utmost accuracy in the interpretation of conferences on behalf of our client and translation of important legal documents.</p>
            <p>Grace is not only highly professional, she is sensitive and highly intuitive to the needs of the client.</p>
            <p>I regard Grace as being the best Vietnamese interpreter in Australia and in my view she is the best interpreter in any language and I urge anyone seeking an outstanding interpreter to contact her.</p>

            <p> Highly recommended if you want to pass your CCL test!!! I took 1 on 1 lessons with Dr. Giao Quynh Tran and passed my CCL test. Dr. Giao Tran provides excellent training for the CCL test. She knows just what students need to pass the test. She is also very dedicated in her teaching and supporting her students. In addition, her lessons are fun, engaging and practical. They are tailored to suit the need of her students. Thanks to her, not only did I pass the test, my Vietnamese and English vocabulary and grammar have also improved. I highly recommend her if you want to pass your CCL. <br>Ratings: <br>Quality: 5 stars out of 5<br>Reliability:5 stars out of 5 <br>Friendliness: 5 stars out of 5</p>
            <h2>Trang (Merry) Bui</h2>
            <h4> Prior to training at Elite Interpreters, Translators & Teachers (ELITE ITT), Trang invested in one-on-one lessons elsewhere but she still failed the NAATI CCL test. So she found the test score of 63/90 out of reach. When she came to ELITE ITT towards the end of 2019, she said to Dr Tran: “I don’t think I can pass the test in January 2020”. Dr Tran said: “I think you can”. Trang said: “Maybe I need to study a Diploma of Interpreting course”. Dr Tran said: “No, you don’t”. After completing the one-on-one lessons with Dr Tran, Trang passed the NAATI CCL test on the FIRST attempt at 71/90 in January 2020. <br><br>
                The key is not the one-on-one lessons but with whom.<br><br> </h4>

I highly recommend Dr. Giao Tran for those who want to pass the CCL test.<br>Ratings: <br>Quality: 5 stars out of 5<br>Reliability:5 stars out of 5 <br>Friendliness: 5 stars out of 5 </p>
            <h2>Minh Thu Doan</h2>
            <h4> Prior to training at ELITE ITT, Minh Thu trained elsewhere but she failed the CCL test at such a low score that her classmates there,<br> who also failed at similar scores, saw no hope of passing the test. Following a course with Dr Giao Quynh Tran (Dr Grace Tran) at ELITE ITT,<br> her test score rocketed and she passed the CCL test to gain 5 immigration bonus points. She is now considering becoming a professional interpreter and translator.</h4>

            <p>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</p>
            <p>How fortunate am I for being destined to learn from Dr Giao Quynh Tran (Dr Grace Tran) at Elite Interpreters, Translators &amp; Teachers (ELITE ITT). Every day of studying with her is a new horizon and her lessons amaze me always.</p>
            <p>I first came to Dr Giao Tran in the middle of September 2019 to study professional translation. At that time, my English proficiency level did not meet NAATI's criteria for taking the translation tests. Particularly, my PTE score was 76 overall with 79 for Writing, 68 for Listening, 79 for Grammar and 63 for Pronunciation.</p>
            <p>I have been studying English to Vietnamese and Vietnamese to English translation under Dr Giao Tran in a one-on-one class since 17/9/2019. Part of the study with her includes Grammar and English proficiency. After only 9 sessions of 3 hours each with her, my Grammar, Pronunciation, Writing and Listening, which are fundamental to a high PTE test score, have improved so much that I scored 89 overall with 89 for Writing, 90 for Listening, 90 for Grammar, 90 for Pronunciation and all other Enabling Skills in my PTE test on 28/10/2019. This proves that studying for the NAATI tests with Dr Giao Tran has the effect of improving not only my translation skills remarkably but also my PTE score significantly.</p>
            <p>It is evident that Dr Giao Tran's teaching methods are effective. Through my impressive PTE score that I achieved just by seriously making efforts to follow her teachings and instructions, I firmly believe that there will be a possible outcome for my NAATI professional translation tests, too.</p>
            <p>ELITE ITT is the right place. Dr Giao Tran is the right teacher. <br>Ratings: <br>Quality: 5 stars out of 5<br>Reliability:5 stars out of 5 <br>Friendliness: 5 stars out of 5 </p>

            <p>I attended the 1:1 CCL lessons with Dr. Giao Quynh Tran. She is a very friendly, dedicated teacher who really goes the distance for her students. Her lessons gave me a lot of helpful tips for the CCL. The training sessions were thoughtfully structured with both practical and interesting learning activities. Thank you so much for your dedication. You really made passing the CCL achievable for me. <br> Ratings: <br>Quality: 5 stars out of 5<br>Reliability:5 stars out of 5 <br>Friendliness: 5 stars out of 5</p>

            <p>ELITE ITT's courses are very good, making a practical contribution to the community and creating good work opportunities for students. Dr Giao Quynh Tran is a gifted and the best Vietnamese interpreter & translator in Australia. I have known Dr Tran for about 9 years, and I know very well her outstanding ability in interpreting, translation and teaching as well as her exceptional interpreting, translating and teaching skills. Dr Tran is the greatest asset of ELITE ITT and of any academic programs in Interpreting and Translation that she teaches. I am certain that Dr Tran's ELITE ITT is the best in the industry.</p>

            <p>During 33 years working in Vietnamese-Australian media, we have had the opportunities to interview Australian politicians in many areas from state to federal governments. On a number of occasions Federal politicians needed an interpreter in press conferences in both the Vietnamese and English languages. I listened to Dr Giao Tran's interpreting. Her interpreting style is characterized by her precise wording and clarity, making many listeners have the impression that the speakers were Vietnamese native speakers rather than foreigners. Therefore, her interpreting helps the speakers win the listeners' favour. In my opinion, the interpreter in that circumstance played a very successful role. Specially Dr Tran always fulfills her duties and responsibilities.</p>

	    <h3>********</h3>
            <p>ELITE ITT's courses are very useful for beginners who would like to become Level 2 interpreters and for Level 2 interpreters who would like to upgrade to Level 3. Dr Giao Quynh Tran is not only a successful NAATI Level 3 interpreter but also a PhD. She's both talented and nice.</p>
            <p>Moreover, she has a Linguistic background so she interprets very competently. Interpreters from other professional backgrounds and without formal training in Linguistics can hardly do so. Having listened to her interpreting, I reckon that she interprets very accurately and that she is a very reliable interpreter.</p>
            <p>On many occasions different colleagues, who were not aware that I knew Giao, told me that they met in court a lady interpreter who is young but interprets so beautifully. That's Giao. So indeed, she is a well-known interpreter and is at the top of this profession. Her teaching is surely high quality teaching.</p>
